Hey, welcome to your own file struture!

The commands used for the file system are a mix of Windows and Unix commands. They're mostly either self-explanatory ore widely known.
The file system also works with relative paths handled by the os module, so the path formatting is inherited from the host OS.

Enjoy your stay!
